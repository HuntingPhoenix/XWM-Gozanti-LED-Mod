# XWM-Gozanti-LED-Mod
LED modification of a Gozanti cruiser from X-Wing miniatures

This project is the modification of a Gozanti cruiser miniature from Fantasy Flight's X-Wing miniatures.  Star Wars, X-Wing, Fantasy Flight, etc. are all owned by their respective rights holders, etc.  This is simply a fan modification I wanted to share.  If there's a problem, please contact me.

The 3d modeled parts are all created by me, and posted for remixing or improvements.  Please also share your improvements!

Parts lists, diagrams, and images will be found on the project wiki.
